						<p>On February 24th, <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> added the <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/02/reactions-now-available-globally/">Facebook Reactions feature</a> across all platforms, allowing to users to show more than a Like, but also <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Haha</strong>, <strong>Wow</strong>, <strong>Sad</strong>, and <strong>Angry</strong>. These additional actions are revealed by hovering over the Like button on Web, or tap-and-holding the button on mobile devices.</p>

<p><img src="/img/interactive-reactions/reactions_gif_60.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2016/02/facebook-reactions/">wrote an article</a> at that time lamenting the design decision, arguing that most of those emotions are redundant with Likes, and I was also annoyed about the lack of easy access to bulk Reactions data via Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Graph API</a> for further analysis. Thanks to a recently-discovered workaround, I am now able to scrape the Reactions data from <em>any</em> public Facebook Page using my updated <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper">Facebook Page Post Scraper</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn/">CNN&rsquo;s Facebook Page</a>, which has made 4,629 Facebook Posts in the four months since the implementation of Reactions. As a news organization, CNN makes Posts on a wide variety of subjects, which we would expect to trigger a wide variety of reactions.</p>

<p>First, we can check the daily marketshare of Reactions to see which ones are the most popular:</p>

<p><img src="/img/interactive-reactions/reaction-example-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And we have a problem. Likes <em>technically</em> count as Reactions. And since Likes are much easier for users to perform, they typically comprise of more than 75% of the total Reactions.</p>

<p>To further compound this problem, when using the CNN dataset, Likes are <strong>strongly positively correlated</strong> with <strong>Love</strong> and <strong>Wow</strong> (implying potentially redundant variables), and Likes are weakly <em>positively</em> correlated with <strong>Sad</strong> and <strong>Angry</strong> (which doesn&rsquo;t make intuitive sense).</p>

<p><img src="/img/interactive-reactions/cor.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It is my belief that <strong>Likes are now a statistical red herring</strong> used by Facebook to identify low-effort data from people who just tap the Like button. If we <strong>ignore Likes completely</strong>, both problems are resolved; we have 25% Reaction data left which is more-than-enough on large Facebook pages, and the correlations of non-Like variables are weaker and provide more independent information.</p>

<p>But can looking at the counts of <strong>Wow</strong>, <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Haha</strong>, <strong>Sad</strong>, and <strong>Angry</strong> reactions on Facebook Posts be used to accurately classify their sentiment? If so, can we quantify that sentiment? What makes a Facebook Post <strong>Wow</strong> but not <strong>Haha</strong>? I downloaded the Reactions data from the Top 100+ Facebook Pages, and the results turned out better than expected.</p>

<h2>That Makes Me Feel Angry</h2>

<p>For each Facebook Post from a Facebook Page, I look at the relative percentages of the <strong>Wow</strong>, <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Haha</strong>, <strong>Sad</strong>, and <strong>Angry</strong> counts on a given Post, ignoring Likes (i.e. the percentage of <strong>Wow</strong> on a Post is the count of <strong>Wow</strong> reactions divided by the sum of the <strong>Wow</strong>, <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Haha</strong>, <strong>Sad</strong>, and <strong>Angry</strong> counts). Then, I filter the results Posts dataset to Posts which have atleast <strong>75%</strong> of an emotion, and classifying the Post with that emotion (additionally, I only keep Posts where the percentage proportion is greater than 75% with 99% statistical confidence). This approach mitigates the possibility of misclassifying the emotion of a Post, and also penalizes Posts with insufficient amounts of Reactions data.</p>

<p>Due to the layers of filtering involved and the sample sizes needed to ensure statistical confidence, <em>and</em> the fact that only an extremely small fraction of a Page&rsquo;s userbase provide any engagement (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)">1% rule</a>), this methodology will only work on Facebook Pages with <em>millions</em> of active readers. In CNN&rsquo;s case, there are 576 Posts (12%) which fit the criteria above.</p>

<p>We can group by emotion category and scale from 75%—100% emotional response. The result is this for the CNN dataset:</p>

<p><img src="/img/interactive-reactions/facebook-reaction-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the interactive version of this chart at the beginning of the article, you can mouse over a point to see the news headline corresponding to that data point.</p>

<p>And the news headlines match the classified emotion surprisingly well. <strong>Wow</strong> Posts are about neat things, <strong>Sad</strong> Posts are typically about deaths, <strong>Haha</strong> Posts capture genuinely funny headlines, and <strong>Angry</strong> Posts capture controversial and negative topics (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner">Brock Turner case</a>). <strong>Love</strong> is for everything positive in between which doesn&rsquo;t fit into the above categories.</p>

<p>CNN has a nice variety of emotional responses, but how do they compare to other news sources, like the BBC?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: The rest of the charts in this blog post are ALL interactive! Enjoy!</strong></p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<h2>All the Feels</h2>

<p>So some pages have <em>specific</em> emotional targets. Fox News has an unusual proportion of <strong>Angry</strong> Facebook Posts, and from my research, they are the only large page that does so.</p>

<p>In order to test the validity of this approach, we must look at many different types of pages. Several Facebook Pages focus on comedic, <strong>Haha</strong> Posts relative to other emotions. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheOnion/">The Onion</a>, the premier satire publication, is the king (not shown because there are <em>thousands</em> of data points). Semi-relevant music duo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lmfao">LMFAO</a> has posted quite a few random comedic listicles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had zero success finding pages which focus on <strong>Sad</strong> Posts, though, which makes sense. <strong>Love</strong> is a different story.</p>

<h2>Friendliness Pellets</h2>

<p>The correlation between Likes and <strong>Loves</strong> earlier was 0.80. As you&rsquo;ve seen from the charts above, <strong>Loves</strong> are an extension of Likes, but more so in the sense that <strong>Loves</strong> are positive emotions which are NOT <strong>Wows</strong> and NOT <strong>Hahas</strong>. There is an extra granularity, and Pages often focus on <strong>Love</strong> with little inclusion of other sentiments.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with one public figure loved by millions on the Internet: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JustinBieber/">Justin Bieber</a>, of course.</p>

<p>The conclusion of all these charts? Yes, it turns out that Reactions data can indeed be used to be classify the emotional response of Facebook Posts at a more granular level than just a Like/Dislike button&hellip;but only if there is a large amount of data available. Me giving a single <strong>Wow</strong> on a random friend&rsquo;s Facebook Post says absolutely nothing about the sentiment of the Post (and in my case, the <strong>Wow</strong> is often sarcastic anyways).</p>

<p>The follow-up question that many social-media coordinators reading this post are asking is &ldquo;which type of emotion on Facebook Posts leads to the largest number of total Reactions?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s hard to say at the moment and requires further analysis. Or even if the implementation of Reactions actually leads to higher total engagement with Facebook Posts than the previous Likes-only system, which is likely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator">KPI</a> from Facebook&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<p>At the least, <em>accurate</em> semantic language data is <em>very</em> valuable in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> and the data from these tagged Facebook Posts can be used to build more accurate classifiers for all five emotions for use in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>. Making pretty interactive charts is merely the start.</p>
